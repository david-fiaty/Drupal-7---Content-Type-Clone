<h3 id="project-description">Synopsis</h3>
Content Type Clone allows Drupal users with the "Administer content types" permission 
to clone content types in one click. 

Access the content type list, click on "clone" for the one you want to clone, save the clone form.
The module will then clone the clone the target content type, and copy all it fields to the 
newly created content type.

Content Type Clone also offers the options to:

 * Copy all nodes from the source content type to the target content type
 * Delete all nodes from the source content type after they have been copied to the target content type.

The Content Type Clone module has been created in order to offer a simple way to clone content types in Drupal.

This module will also allow you to clone a content type by exporting it, 
replacing the required fields, and then importing the updated php code in order 
to get a renamed copy of the content type that needs cloning.

Bundle Copy has a lot of other great features but Content Type Clone focuses on 
cloning a content type quickly and efficiently.
Sometimes you just want to clone a content type in one click without having to 
look at PHP code or perform too many actions.
